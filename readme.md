# Doc-Tag

## Description
This tool basically searches the given word within pdf files in a specific location or directory. This program searches one or more keywords and generates an html report of it ,i.e what sort of information is found. 

### How To Run This Project

> Since the project use python-2.7 I recommend you to run it with repl for py2.7

#### Run the Application

```bash
# Install Python 2.7 
$ sudo apt install python2
$ python2 --version

# Clone into YOUR local drive
$ git clone https://github.com/codetronaut/doc_tag_test.git

#move to project
$ cd doc_tag_test

# Run 
$ python2 Doc_Tag.py
```
`Note: you can also change your directory(in which your are going to search) right now i have hard coded it to the PDFs directory.`

### Tools Used:
It is coded in fully python with the help of crucial modules i.e [PDFminer](https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six) and [markdown](https://python-markdown.github.io).

### Contribution:
willing to contribute let's get started.
The main issues to be resolved are:
* Shipping this current version(i.e python-2.7) to python-3.x.
* Enabling back support for some modules which are deprecated(for python-2.7).
* Refactor the code and write more comments for easy understanding to those who are new.
* Shoot any other your ideas to me if any :) 

Peace!
